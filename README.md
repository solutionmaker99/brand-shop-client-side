- 1 . SwiperSlide

Swiper is a JavaScript library that creates modern touch sliders with hardware-accelerated transitions (utilizing GPU to offload graphic-intensive transitions and create smoother visuals) and excellent native behavior. Swiper is available for vanilla JavaScript, Angular, React, Vue.js, and Svelte.

- 2 . Vercel

Vercel is the platform for frontend developers, providing the speed and reliability innovators need to create at the moment of inspiration.

- 3 . SweetAlert

A beautiful replacement for JavaScript confirms the message! It will replace the ugly confirmation message with a beautiful customizable and fully functional modal.

- 4 . 404 Not Found Page

When you click on a link, but instead of arriving to the site you want, an error message appears, stating that the page you requested is unavailable. It should be something along the lines of '404 Not Found.'

- 5 . Password Regular Expression

Regular expressions are programmatic strings used to check whether an input string meets specific criteria. In Specops Password Policy, the string we are checking is a requested new password or passphrase, and the policy filter will allow the new password/passphrase only if it matches the regular expression.
